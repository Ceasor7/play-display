Mrenje is a gambler who has fallen on hard times in Nairobi where Matam, his wife, is pregnant. On this day, Matam makes so much noise, suggesting pain, that Mrenje decides to take her to hospital.
But because he has no money, to call a taxi, or bodaboda, he drags and pushes and pulls the wife to a bus stop. The buses and matatu, and even a private car, won’t pick the pair from the bus stop as they have no money.
Only a driverless bodaboda stops, but it won’t move when Mrenje tries to restart it. It can’t be pushed. Its wheels are gone. Soon, Matam has labor pains and must give birth at the bus stop’s bench. There will be a small celebration by Mrenje, only for him to give back the baby to Matam who discovers the child can’t hear, can’t see, can’t breathe!
There will follow the rituals of mourning and burial at the street’s bus stop.
