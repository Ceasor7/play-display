## Synopsis

A 56-year-old man who has always been fascinated by rituals around death and the mourning processes pounces on his 21 year old daughter for an experiment at his rural, back of beyond farm in Kenya‚Äôs Nanyuki. In his imagination, death frees, it purifies, it cleanses, just like his name ‚ÄúMunanda‚Äù which translates to a cattle dip, for cleansing!

The problem is that his 21 year daughter, P. Munanda, is full of hope, listens to ‚Äúwhite people‚Äôs‚Äù music, has a boyfriend and sees a future through her phone and the trappings of modern gadgetry which connects her to friends, and other worlds beyond the dreariness of rural Kenya. The man tries to drill his version of tradition, culture, and religion into the girl, through seductive mythical stories, but the girl rejects them. He resorts to physical abuse, but she stands her ground, refuses the terror, and should in the end recapture her dignity, even if via a cunning, or even lucky, overturning of the physical power!

This is a story of the undermining of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù power, but steeped in a bitterness of memories of family secrets which refuse to remain hidden. The delight is in how ancient biblical stories tally with tales, and mythical characters, from old African settings; but mostly in how the underdog refuses to die in the face of sheer raw power!

### Dr Emmanuel Shikuku

<p>

      I am a teacher and lecturer of artists who believes in teaching by doing. That explains my creative acumen which has seen me act and direct creative works for and with my students. Among the plays I have directed are David Mulwa's Redemption, Wole Soyinka's The Lion and The Jewel, Austin Bukenya's The Bride as well as Francis Imbuga's The Successor. I have acted in a number of plays such as The Island by Athol Fugard and films including Biko Nyongesa's When the Gods Argue.

      I see myself as an all-round artist who will summon the benefits of the ever-changing technologies to advance the course of arts and culture and create synergies and collaborations within and between different cultures, peoples, and societies.
