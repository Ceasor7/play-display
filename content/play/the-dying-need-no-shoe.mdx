A 56-year-old man who has always been fascinated by rituals around death and the mourning processes pounces on his 21 year old daughter for an experiment at his rural, back of beyond farm in Kenya’s Nanyuki. In his imagination, death frees, it purifies, it cleanses, just like his name “Munanda” which translates to a cattle dip, for cleansing!

The problem is that his 21 year daughter, P. Munanda, is full of hope, listens to “white people’s” music, has a boyfriend and sees a future through her phone and the trappings of modern gadgetry which connects her to friends, and other worlds beyond the dreariness of rural Kenya. The man tries to drill his version of tradition, culture, and religion into the girl, through seductive mythical stories, but the girl rejects them. He resorts to physical abuse, but she stands her ground, refuses the terror, and should in the end recapture her dignity, even if via a cunning, or even lucky, overturning of the physical power!

This is a story of the undermining of “traditional” power, but steeped in a bitterness of memories of family secrets which refuse to remain hidden. The delight is in how ancient biblical stories tally with tales, and mythical characters, from old African settings; but mostly in how the underdog refuses to die in the face of sheer raw power!
